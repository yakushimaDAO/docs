## What is Yakushima DAO ?

It comes from a simple idea: How to revolutionize the Manga / Gaming ultra-centralized business as early adopters of new decentralized blockchain-based tools. Weâ€™re huge geeks fans of japan & cyberpunk universe and are influenced by Japanese anime/manga masterpieces such as Shingeki no kyojin, Death Note, Tokyo Ghoul, and obviously DragonBall, Ghost in the Shellâ€¦ We wanted to create our own universe in a cyberpunk world with the finest Japanese legends and Geeks winks.
or that, we surrounded ourselves with talented mangakas and 2D animators for the creation of a manga and an anime. As well as 3D & Unreal Engine developers for the creation of characters, weapons, vehicles based on our history â€¦ Fully usable in the metaverse or in a future video game.
We still have a lot of work to do! And we need you to co-develop this amazing universe and the on-going DAO. Quality takes time, that is why we are relying on you!

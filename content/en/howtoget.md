## There will be 3 primary ways to acquire $YAKU within the Yakuverse

* Holding your collections: On launch day, daily airdrops of $YAKU will begin. For every day you have your holdings delisted, you will receive: 

    - 2 $YAKU per day for every motorcycle
    - 4 $YAKU per day for every avatar
    - 6 $YAKU per day for every capsule. 

An additional 12 $YAKU per day for each complete set of three you are holding

* Staking your motorcycle: On launch day, you will be able to stake your motorcycle(s) in your garage. You will receive 6 $YAKU per day, per bike in addition to the standard 2 per day for holding.
* Racing your motorcycle: Every first place finish grants the winner 3 $YAKU, second place 2 $YAKU and third place 1 $YAKU

## In a two year timeline, this will mean: 

* A maximum of 122,640,000 $YAKU, 24.53% of the entire supply, can be distributed via air-drop should 7,000 unique individuals hold complete sets, 
* A maximum of 30,660,000 $YAKU, 6.13% of the entire supply, can be distributed via motor-cycle staking, 
* If all 7,000 motorcycles are owned by unique holders and each holder acquires 60 $YAKU via racing every day (twenty 1st place finishes, 30 second place, etc.), 306,600,000 $YAKU, 61.32% of the entire supply, will be distributed via racing.

The remaining 8.02% will be set aside and distributed via prize pools for race tournaments, marketing efforts and other DAO decided purposes.

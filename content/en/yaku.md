The $YAKU token is packed with utility in the Yakuverse. For this reason, it is very important that we set up an enticing distribution method, liquidity backing and supply count that takes into account the long term growth of the project. 

## Maximum Supply

* 500,000,000 $YAKU

* All $YAKU will be in circulation within 2 years of the intended launch day, day 1 of 2nd Step 2022.

## General Info

The $YAKU token’s liquidity will be built using a portion of income from direct $SOL sales.

To assure the solvency of the game for many years to come, we are looking for ways to further monetize the Yakuverse. We also want to avoid creating a pay to win scenario. So, we are following in the footsteps of other games before us like League of Legends and allowing for purchases using $SOL directly (without the need to buy a second in-game currency like Riot Points, however). This will come with a big caveat: $SOL will only be able to be used to purchase cosmetic upgrades for your metaverse assets and DAO approved premium experiences.

While you will be able to play and earn $YAKU to do things like add and upgrade weapons, change your motocycle’s engine, etc. you will not be able to make those same upgrades using $SOL. The prices of items in $SOL within the store will be subject to change with the flux in value of $YAKU.

Both Yaku store pricing and percentage of $YAKU burned will be subject to change based on Yakuverse economic fluctuations. As this is the core of the Yakuverse economy and its utility will only grow, we want to be sure to accommodate necessary changes that arise.
